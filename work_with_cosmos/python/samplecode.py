DESCRIPTION:
    This file provides a guided experience in performing a few basic tasks against Azure Cosmos DB.
USAGE: python samplecode.py
    IMPORTANT:
    Make sure you have retrieved the primary connection string from the pre-deployed Cosmos DB account
    using the Azure Portal. Find the my_connection_string variable, below, and assign the connection string
    that you copied to that variable by pasting it between the double-quotes.
    
    Save your work before running the code.

        then, you will instantiate the CosmosClient object.
